Soil carbon fractionation scheme comparison project

This project hosts data from G. Miller comparing data from three soil carbon fractionation schemes: Ghani, Sohi, and Zimmerman. The goal of the project is to assess the utility of these schemes for understanding soil carbon dynamics. Code (in the src directory) runs in the R environment and utilizes the tools in the SoilR package to estimate mean ages and transit times of soil carbon in models derived from the above fractionation schemes.
