# gm-14c
Soil carbon fractionation scheme comparison project

This project hosts data from G. Miller comparing data from three soil carbon fractionation schemes: Ghani, Sohi, and Zimmerman. The goal of the project is to assess the utility of these schemes for understanding soil carbon dynamics. Code (in the src directory) runs in the R environment and utilizes the tools in the SoilR package to estimate mean ages and transit times of soil carbon. See the [.Rmd](src/gm-14c.Rmd) file or accompanying [.pdf](src/gm-14c.pdf) to learn more.

**Update:** 
The most current report is located [**here**](src/gm-14c.16-05-2020.html). Note that you will need to download the file locally in order to view it. This report is in html format, as the Monte Carlo parameter estimations are very time consuming and must be redone every time the .Rmd script is knitted to .pdf format. Since this work is in-progress, the html file (link above) is the most up-to-date version available.
