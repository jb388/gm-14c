    - Hi Jeff

      Cc. Gemma



      Thanks for meeting us today.



      Had a quick look and found these data files from Sarah (MRT calc) and Mark (Meathrop model info) from an initial play around with numbers to infer MRT and C input rates.



      I can see many SoilR papers in the literature but if you could send us a couple of the ones you recommended as a starting point that would be great. If you have time in June, a follow-up meeting (including Bob, Sarah and Kirsty) to have a quick look at SoilR and simple modelling for the three fractionation methods we compared would be very helpful.



      Best wishes

      Joanna
  - MRT calc_SB - Pool.xlsx:
    - each tab (except 'Data') contains mean residence time calculations for a single fraction from each of the three fractionation approaches tested
    - note that J. Beem-Miller deleted an extra space on sheet 'Data' so that cell B3 would read WS1 not "WS 1"
  - Copy of Meathop Model_NHLevin_2016.xlsx:
    - single pool model approach using atmospheric 14C record and 14C contents of pool given a particular mean residence time (e.g. 1, 2, ... , n years)
    - atmospheric 14C data from Ingeborg Levin
