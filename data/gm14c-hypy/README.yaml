    Subject: RE: Standard test data and Zimmermann POM fraction black C



    Hi Joanna,



    I actually just got results for the BC fraction of the POM-good timing! Unfortunately I didn't get results for the bulk soil, as there wasn't enough CO2- I'll need to repeat this with a larger sample.



    Anyway, the POM results are:



    Sample ID d13C

    %C pMC +/-

    14C age BP +/-

    SUERC-67369 -23.4

    5.46 9.86 +/- 0.11

    18610 +/- 89



    So the POM black carbon fraction is quite old, either a mixture of old and young carbon, or the BC is homogenous and really is all 18a old. I can't tell which from the data, but presumably we could work this out with more work.



    Let me know what you think!



    Best wishes,



    Philippa
