    - Hi Jeff,



      Glad you decided to stay with your wife and dog, definitely better not to be alone!



      Spreadsheet attached has C stock / concentration info.



      For the C inputs, this is from my thesis. Jo feel free to chip in here!





      1. The measured 14C content (pMC) of each SOM fraction and whole soil sample is used to compare and constrain the calculated soil 14C with the measured value.

      2. The ratio of C input added to the C pool, as an approximation of C turnover.

      3. The SOC stock, expressed in units of g m-2is used to estimate the C added to the top soil.

      4. Microsoft Excel’s Solver package is used to minimise the difference between calculated and measured soil 14C by changing the annual input to the soil C pool. In addition Solver is used to constrain the model when estimating the quantity of added C to the soil. A realistic estimate is sufficient to prevent the model producing impractical outputs resulting from the opportunity of two outcomes, associated with the rise and fall of the bomb-14C peak



      Hope you’re both keeping well,



      Gemma
